### Self-hosting
As Sentry is open-source, you can always run it yourself. Simply:

  1. `git clone` the repo
  2. Run `npm install`
  3. Configure your Sentry instance by making a .env file - there is a template in [.env.example](.env.example).
  
Now you can run your bot with `npm start`! ðŸŽ‰

## Reporting issues
Please report any issues with any instance of the bot (as long as it is concerning an official bug/feature of Sentry and not a modification made by another instance owner) to the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/Anidox/Sentry/issues). You can track progress with the tracker link in the [Notion page](https://www.notion.so/Sentry-9b1df2c92d8448a3934ec3de74217061)

## Development
Feel free to contribute to Sentry, or even just add features to your own instance. Simply fork and make a pull request. Add `WIP` add the start of the title of your pull request if it is a work in progress and should not be merged.

When contributing to Sentry, please follow the code style used throughout. The ESLint config is provided. When developing, you can use `npm run dev`, which adds ESLint checking on run. Please make sure you have no ESLint warnings/errors before pushing. You may bypass warnings where absolutely neccesary (e.g. when there is no other possible/viable way).
